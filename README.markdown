# Puppet Local Security Policy 

created by Paul Cannon at email paulscannon at gmail dot com 

## Local_security_policy features
Configure, local security policy (LSP) for windows servers.  
LSP is key to a baseline configuration of the following security features:

### Account Policy
* Password Policy
* Account Lockout Policy

### Local Policy
* Audit Policy
* User Rights Assignment
* Security Options
* Registry Values


This module uses types and providers to list, update, validate settings

## Use
The title and name of the resources is exact match of what is in secedit GUI.  If you are uncertain of the setting name and values just user 'resource' to pipe them all into a file and make adjustments as necessary.
The block will look like this
```
local_security_policy { 'Audit account logon events': <- Title / Name
  ensure         => present,              <- Always present
  policy_setting => "AuditAccountLogon",  <- The secedit file key. Informational purposes only, not for use in manifest definitions
  policy_type    => "Event Audit",        <- The secedit file section, Informational purposes only, not for use in manifest definitions
  policy_value   => 'Success,Failure',    <- Values
}
```


### Listing all settings
Show all local_security_policy resources available on server
```
puppet resource local_security_policy
```
Show a single local_security_policy resources available on server
```
puppet resource local_security_policy 'Maximum password age'
```

### More examples
Example Password Policy
```
local_security_policy { 'Maximum password age':
  ensure => present,
  policy_value => '90',
}
```

Example Audit Policy
```
local_security_policy { 'Audit account logon events':
  ensure => present,
  policy_value => 'Success,Failure',
}
```

Example User Rights Policy
```
local_security_policy { 'Allow log on locally':
  ensure => present,
  policy_value => '90',
}
```
Example Security Settings
```
local_security_policy { 'System cryptography: Use FIPS compiant algorithms for encryption, hashing, and signing':
  ensure => present,
  policy_value => 1 ,
}
```
